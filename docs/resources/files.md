## Schema

### Required

- `author` (Map of String) `object({ name=string, email=string, message=string })` Defines the commit user and message.
- `branch` (String) This is the branch the files will commit into. The branch must exist.

- `organization` (String) Sets the organization in git the repository is in.
- `repository` (String) Respository name you want to commit into.

### Optional

- `force_new` (Boolean) Ensure your files are always pushed into the branch. If the branch is generated in the apply and doesn't exist yet set this to true

- `contents` (String) String contents of this file. Bested used with templates
