  Git provider has a single resource `git_files` which allows you to add files and/or ignore them unlike the github provider

# git Provider

Solve the problem of the GitHub provider which adds files but expects them to always exist whenever you run an `apply`.

This allows you to add the one resource block, `git_files` and add as many `files` into it. These files will be added to your
target branch and repo. Unlike the GitHub provider which doesn't obey `ignore_changes` and will always re-add the files if 
they've been merged into another branch or removed. This will respect `ignore_changes = [file]` and allow the files to be added
but not force them to always re-create.

If you are using the provider in an organization you need to create a PAT that can commit changes to the target repo.
Just set the `owner = <YOUR GIT ORG>` and `token = <PAT>`.
